# hShopCLI
A crappy command line thing for hShop

# Download 
Download the source and compile it yourself, ill maybe add a appveyor eventually

reason: because i made it in NET 5 and if you don't have NET 5 then the compiled pre packaged EXE is like... 60 MB

# Why?
cause i got bored

# Support
how can you need support for this
